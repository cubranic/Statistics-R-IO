=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Statistics::R::REXP::Expression
    
    # Representation of the R call C<expresson(1 + 2))>:
    my $vec = Statistics::R::REXP::Expression->new([
        Statistics::R::REXP::Language->new([
            Statistics::R::REXP::Symbol->new('+'),
            Statistics::R::REXP::Double->new([1]),
            Statistics::R::REXP::Double->new([2])
    ])]);
    print $vec->elements;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object of this class represents an R expression vectors
(C<EXPRSXP>). These objects represent a list of calls, symbols, etc.,
for example as returned by calling R function C<parse> or
C<expression>.


=head1 METHODS

C<Statistics::R::REXP:Expression> inherits from
L<Statistics::R::REXP::List>, with no added restrictions on the value
of its elements.

=over

=item sexptype

SEXPTYPE of expressions is C<EXPRSXP>.

=item to_pl

Perl value of the expression vector is an array reference to the Perl
values of its C<elements>. (That is, it's equivalent to C<map
{$_->to_pl}, $vec->elements>.) Unlike L<List>, elements that are
atomic vectors of length 1 are still represented as a one-element
array reference, rather than scalar values.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Classes in the C<REXP> hierarchy are intended to be immutable. Please
do not try to change their value or attributes.

There are no known bugs in this module. Please see
L<Statistics::R::IO> for bug reporting.
