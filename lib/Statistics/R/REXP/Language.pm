=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Statistics::R::REXP::Language
    
    # Representation of the R call C<mean(c(1, 2, 3))>:
    my $vec = Statistics::R::REXP::Language->new([
        Statistics::R::REXP::Symbol->new('mean'),
        Statistics::R::REXP::Double->new([1, 2, 3])
    ]);
    print $vec->elements;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object of this class represents an R language vector (C<LANGSXP>).
These objects represent calls (such as model formulae), with first
element a reference to the function being called, and the remainder
the actual arguments of the call. Names of arguments, if given, are
recorded in the 'names' attribute (itself as
L<Statistics::R::REXP::Character> vector), with unnamed arguments
having name C<''>. If no arguments were named, the language objects
will not have a defined 'names' attribute.


=head1 METHODS

C<Statistics::R::REXP:Language> inherits from
L<Statistics::R::REXP::Vector>, with the added restriction that its
first element has to be a L<Statistics::R::REXP::Symbol> or another
C<Language> instance. Trying to create a Language instance that
doesn't follow this restriction will raise an exception.

=over

=item sexptype

SEXPTYPE of language vectors is C<LANGSXP>.

=item to_pl

Perl value of the language vector is an array reference to the Perl
values of its C<elements>. (That is, it's equivalent to C<map
{$_->to_pl}, $vec->elements>.
