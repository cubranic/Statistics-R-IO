=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Statistics::R::IO::Rserve;
    
    my $rserve = Statistics::R::IO::RDS->new('someserver');
    my $var = $rserve->eval('1+1');
    print $var->to_pl;
    $rserve->close;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Statistics::R::IO::Rserve> provides an object-oriented interface to
communicate with the L<Rserve|http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/> binary R
server.

This allows Perl programs to access all facilities of R without the
need to have a local install of R or link to an R library.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 CONSTRUCTOR

=over

=item new $server

The single-argument constructor can be invoked with a scalar
containing the host name of the Rserve server. The method will
immediately open a connection to the server using L<IO::Socket::INET>
and perform the initial steps prescribed by the protocol. The method
will raise an exception if the connection cannot be established or if
the remote host does not appear to run the correct version of Rserve.

=item new $handle

The single-argument constructor can be invoked with an instance of
L<IO::Handle> containing the connection to the Rserve server, which
becomes the 'fh' attribute. The caller is responsible for ensuring
that the connection is established and ready for submitting client
requests.

=item new ATTRIBUTE_HASH_OR_HASH_REF

The constructor's arguments can also be given as a hash or hash
reference, specifying values of the object attributes. The caller
passing the handle is responsible for ensuring that the connection is
established and ready for submitting client requests.

=item new

The no-argument constructor uses the default server name 'localhost'
and port 6311 and immediately opens a connection to the server using
L<IO::Socket::INET>, performing the initial steps prescribed by the
protocol. The method will raise an exception if the connection cannot
be established or if the remote host does not appear to run the
correct version of Rserve.

=back


=head2 ACCESSORS

=over

=item server

Name of the Rserve server.

=item port

Port of the Rserve server.

=item fh

A connection handle (stored as a reference to the L<IO::Handle>) to
the Rserve server.

=back


=head2 METHODS

=over

=item eval EXPR

Evaluates an R expression, given as text string in REXPR, on an
L<Rserve|http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/> server and returns its result
as a L<Statistics::R::REXP> object.

=item ser_eval EXPR

Evaluates an R expression, given as text string in REXPR, on an
L<Rserve|http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/> server and returns its result
as a L<Statistics::R::REXP> object. This method uses the CMD_serEval
Rserve command (code 0xf5), which is designated as "internal/special"
and "should not be used by clients". Consequently, it is not
recommended to use this method in a production environment, but only
to help debug cases where C<eval> isn't working as desired.

=item get_file REMOTE_NAME [, LOCAL_NAME]

Transfers a file named REMOTE_NAME from the Rserve server to the local
machine, copying it to LOCAL_NAME if it is specified. The file is
transferred in binary mode. Returns the contents of the file as a
scalar.

=item close

Closes the object's filehandle. This method is automatically invoked
when the object is destroyed if the connection was opened by the
constructor, but not if it was passed in as a pre-opened handle.
