=head1 NAME

Statistics::R::IO::RDS - Supply object methods for RDS files

=head1 VERSION

version 0.091

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Statistics::R::IO::RDS;
    
    my $rds = Statistics::R::IO::RDS->new('file.rds');
    my $var = $rds->read;
    print $var->to_pl;
    $rds->close;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Statistics::R::IO::RDS> provides an object-oriented interface to
parsing RDS files. RDS files store a serialization of a single R
object (and, if the object contains references to other objects, such
as environments, all the referenced objects as well). These files are
created in R using the C<readRDS> function and are typically named
with the C<.rds> file extension.

=head1 METHODS

C<Statistics::R::IO::RDS> inherits from L<Statistics::R::IO::Base> and
provides an implementation for the L</read> method that parses RDS
files.

=over

=item read

Reads the contents of the filehandle and returns a
L<Statistics::R::REXP>.
